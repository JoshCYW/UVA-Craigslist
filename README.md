Welcome to our UVA Craigslist application, Loxodonta!
This document will first walk through how we envision the app being used, and then will discuss any specific things that we request to be looked at specifically for grading. 

To start, here is the link to the app, deployed on Heroku: https://loxodante.herokuapp.com

This link lands a user on a login page - this page briefly explains what the site is for and asks the user to login with netbadge.
Once the user has gone through the login process, they reach the home page. It is our intention for this page first to clear up for a user any possible ambiguity on the basics of the site that may have existed at login, and then to direct them on how they might use the site themselves. 
The two basic options are to either look for items to buy, or post items to sell. 
If the user intends to buy something, some common categories are listed on the homepage.
If they user intends to sell something, there is a direct link to the page where they can create a listing on the site.

If they choose to visit the already existing posts, they are landed on a page that has several different filters for common types of items: Textbooks, Furniture, Clothes, and Electronics. If an item has been listed as "other", there is a filter for this category as well.

The user can either filter by these categories listed above, or they can search for a more specific item using the search engine at the top of the page.
